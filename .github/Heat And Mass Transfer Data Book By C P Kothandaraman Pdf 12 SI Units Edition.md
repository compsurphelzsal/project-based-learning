The book devotes considerable space to the property values of materials (solids, liquids and gases) that are commonly used in heat transfer situations. Property values for various materials at different temperatures are given for the use of designers. The formulae for heat and mass transfer are arranged in an easily usable tabular form with symbols and units explained alongside. The limitations and restrictions in the use of empirical relationships are also mentioned alongside. The empirical formulae and charts have been selected based on their validity and applicability.
 
The book has been updated with the latest publications and data in the field of heat and mass transfer. A number of charts and data have been added to enhance the value of the book. The presentation on convection has been enlarged, taking into account the recent publications. The book is a comprehensive collection of heat transfer information in SI units for students and practitioners.
 
The book is written by C. P. Kothandaraman and S. Subramanyan, who are both professors of mechanical engineering at PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore, India. They have extensive teaching and research experience in the areas of heat transfer, thermal science and engineering, fluid mechanics, refrigeration and air-conditioning, solar energy and bio-gas applications.
