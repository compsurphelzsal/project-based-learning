## Go Goa Gone Movie Review: A Zomcom with Brains and Laughs
 
Go Goa Gone is not your typical Bollywood movie. It is a zomcom, or a zombie comedy, that blends horror and humor in a refreshing way. The film is directed by Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K., who have previously made quirky comedies like Shor in the City and 99. The film features Saif Ali Khan as Boris, a Russian mafia boss who doubles as a zombie hunter, and Kunal Khemu, Vir Das and Anand Tiwari as three friends who get stuck in a zombie apocalypse on an island in Goa.
 
The film is a spoof of the zombie genre, with references to popular films like Dawn of the Dead, Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead. The film also pokes fun at the stereotypes of Goa, such as the drug culture, the rave parties and the foreign tourists. The film has some hilarious dialogues and situations, such as when the friends try to figure out how to kill zombies, or when Boris explains his motto: "I kill dead people". The film also has some thrilling action sequences, such as when the friends escape from a horde of zombies on a jeep, or when Boris uses his guns and grenades to blast his way through the undead.
 
The film is not for the faint-hearted, as it has some gory scenes of zombies biting and tearing flesh. The film also has some crude language and adult humor, which may not be suitable for everyone. The film could have been better if it had more romance and character development, as the love story between Luv and Luna is barely explored. The film also has some logical flaws and loose ends, such as how the zombies were created by a drug, or what happens to the survivors at the end.
 
Go Goa Gone is a fun and entertaining film that offers something different from the usual Bollywood fare. It is a comedy that makes you laugh and a horror thriller that makes you scream. It is a zomcom with brains and laughs.
