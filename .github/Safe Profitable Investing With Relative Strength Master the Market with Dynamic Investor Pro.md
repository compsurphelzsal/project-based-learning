Relative strength (RS) is a powerful investing technique that compares the performance of different assets or markets over time. It can help you identify the best opportunities to invest in, as well as when to exit them. RS investing is well known among professional investors, but it is not widely documented or taught to individual investors.

That's why Michael J. Carr and Raymond M.F. Dominick wrote the book "Safe Profitable Investing With Relative Strength: And Dynamic Investor Pro" [^1^] [^2^]. In this book, they explain the concepts and theories behind RS investing, and how to apply it in any market condition. They also show how to use a software program called Dynamic Investor Pro (DIP) to implement RS investing easily and effectively.
  
In this article, we will summarize some of the main points from the book, and give you some tips on how to use RS and DIP to improve your investing results.
  
## What is Relative Strength?
  
Relative strength is a measure of how well an asset or a market performs compared to another asset or a market over a given period of time. For example, if you compare the performance of Apple stock (AAPL) to the S&P 500 index (SPX) over the past year, you can calculate the relative strength of AAPL to SPX by dividing the percentage change of AAPL by the percentage change of SPX. If AAPL gained 50% while SPX gained 25%, then the relative strength of AAPL to SPX is 2 (50/25). This means that AAPL outperformed SPX by 100% over the past year.
  
Relative strength can be calculated for any pair of assets or markets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, sectors, industries, countries, etc. It can also be calculated for different time frames, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc. The longer the time frame, the more stable and reliable the relative strength signal is.
  
Relative strength can help you identify the strongest and weakest assets or markets in any given time frame. By investing in the strongest assets or markets, and avoiding or shorting the weakest ones, you can increase your chances of making profits and reducing losses. Relative strength can also help you determine when to enter and exit your positions, by using various indicators and rules based on RS values.
  
## What is Dynamic Investor Pro?
  
Dynamic Investor Pro (DIP) is a software program that allows you to create and test your own RS investing strategies. It has a user-friendly interface that lets you select your assets or markets, your time frame, your indicators, your rules, and your portfolio size. It also has a powerful backtesting engine that lets you see how your strategies would have performed in the past, using historical data from various sources.
  
DIP can help you optimize your RS investing strategies by allowing you to adjust various parameters and see how they affect your results. You can also compare different strategies side by side, and see which one performs better in terms of returns, risk, drawdowns, consistency, etc. DIP can also help you monitor your strategies in real time, by providing you with updated signals and alerts based on current market data.
  
DIP is designed for both beginners and advanced investors who want to use RS investing in their portfolios. It has a comprehensive manual that explains how to use the software and how to create effective RS strategies. It also has a support team that can answer your questions and provide technical assistance.
