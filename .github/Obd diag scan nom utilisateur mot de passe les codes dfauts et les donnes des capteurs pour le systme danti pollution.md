If you have a car that was made after 1996, chances are it has an OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) system that monitors its performance and alerts you when something goes wrong. An OBD diag scan tool is a device that can connect to your car's OBD port and read the error codes that are stored in its computer. These codes can help you identify the cause of the problem and fix it yourself or take it to a mechanic.

In this article, we will explain what an OBD diag scan tool is, how it works, and how to use it to diagnose your car problems.
 
## What is an OBD Diag Scan Tool?
 
An OBD diag scan tool is a device that can communicate with your car's OBD system and access its diagnostic information. There are different types of OBD diag scan tools, such as:
 
- **Display scanners:** These are simple devices that only show the error codes and some basic data. You have to look up the meaning of the codes online or in a manual. They are usually cheap and easy to use, but they may not provide enough information to fix the problem.
- **Diagnostic scanners:** These are more advanced devices that can interpret the error codes and provide more detailed information, such as live data, freeze frame data, readiness tests, and graphs. They may also have additional features, such as resetting the check engine light, clearing the codes, or performing special functions. They are usually more expensive and complex to use, but they can help you diagnose and fix the problem more accurately.
- **Bluetooth scanners:** These are devices that use Bluetooth technology to connect to your smartphone or tablet and use an app to display the diagnostic information. They can offer the same features as display or diagnostic scanners, depending on the app. They are usually convenient and versatile, but they may require internet access or a subscription fee for some functions.

## How Does an OBD Diag Scan Tool Work?
 
An OBD diag scan tool works by plugging into a 16-pin connector that is typically located under the steering wheel column of your car. This connector allows the tool to access your car's OBD system, which is a network of sensors and computers that monitor various aspects of your car's performance, such as engine speed, fuel injection, ignition timing, emissions, and more.

When your car's OBD system detects a problem, it stores an error code in its memory and turns on the check engine light on your dashboard. The error code consists of a letter and four digits that indicate the type and location of the problem. For example, P0300 means a random/multiple cylinder misfire detected.
 
An OBD diag scan tool can read these error codes and display them on its screen or on your smartphone or tablet. You can then use these codes to find out what is wrong with your car and how to fix it.
 
## How to Use an OBD Diag Scan Tool to Diagnose Your Car Problems?
 
To use an OBD diag scan tool to diagnose your car problems, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Locate the OBD port:** Find the 16-pin connector under your steering wheel column or in another location depending on your car model. You can use an online database or a manual to find it.
2. **Plug in the tool:** Turn off your car's engine and plug in the tool into the OBD port. Some tools may require batteries or a power source.
3. **Turn on the tool:** Turn on your car's ignition (but not the engine) and turn on the tool. Some tools may turn on automatically when plugged in.
4. **Read the codes:** Depending on the type of tool you have, you may need to press a button or use an app to scan for error codes. The tool will display the codes on its screen or on your smartphone or tablet. You may see more than one code if there are multiple problems.
5. **Interpret the codes:** Use an online database or a manual to look up the meaning of each code. You may also see some additional information, 8cf37b1e13
